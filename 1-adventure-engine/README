Assignment:
	Create an engine for text-based adventure games.
	The engine must allow for a world with multiple rooms which can be traversed.
	Multiple items may be present in a room, items may be mobile or immobile.
	Mobile items can be taken, carried and dropped by the player. Immobile ones can't.
	There must be a way to specify victory.

Implementation:
	Implementation language is plain C++. Only dependency is tr1/shared_ptr which is in g++ 4.0.0 or higher.
	The code should be platform independent but was not yet tested outside 64-bit Linux.
	Build is makefile-driven, meaning no IDE is needed. See Instructions below.
	However, this package can be used as a project for the "Qt Creator" C++ IDE (open Game.creator).

Noteworthy details:
	Our engine is an actual library with only a public builder interface specified in the headers. 
	This means that you can create a game by including the headers and linking to the precompiled lib, as demoed.
	Arbitrary directional strings - game writer is not limited to a rigid enum.
	The game can not only be won, but also lost.
	Light mechanism is implemented. You need an active light source to interact with dark rooms.

Instructions:
	To compile and link both the library and the demo game, type "make".
	To play, type "make run".
	To automatically execute a scenario from autoplay.txt, type "make autoplay".
